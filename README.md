# EduExplore
  EduExplore is a project I have developed for a course in university called Social-legal aspects of information technologies. The task was to use open data and visualize the information in a more convenient way. 
I chose to make a small web application about schools and kindergartens in Sofia, thus making it easier for parents to obtain basic information about these types of educational institutions. 
#What information can you see?
EduExplore provides information about:
• General count of educational institutions in Sofia
• General count of schools and kindergartens by inhabited areas
• Count and list of schools and kindergartens by inhabited areas
• Count and list of schools and kindergartens by regions
• Count and list of schools according to he institution type
• Count and list of schools according to the detailed institution type
• Count and list of schools and kindergartens according to the the financing type they have
#Technologies used for the project
