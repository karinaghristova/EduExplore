# EduExplore
  EduExplore is a project I have developed for a course in university called Social-legal aspects of information technologies. The task was to use open data and visualize the information in a more convenient way. 
I chose to make a small web application about schools and kindergartens in Sofia, thus making it easier for parents to obtain basic information about these types of educational institutions.
